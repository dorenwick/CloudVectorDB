We need a way of making our data more anisitropic.

1:

first of all, we want a method that looks at all hard-negative candidates.
When we do this, we will want to compute square matrices of the embeddings.
after we do the filtering.

To do this, we will keep the distances of each embedding with each other, and store them during the embeddings computations.

2: I wish to test cagra's ability to index on the cloud, and test its retrieval ability. we should do this on a cheap pc.

3: Work alot on scoring systems, figure out what is best.


COMPUTE DISTANCE MATRICES!!!!!!!  Important.

We will keep the distance matrices of the embeddings.
