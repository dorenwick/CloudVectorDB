Here is how we are going to build a huge dataset of triplets, then train an amazing encoder on it.

We have 2TB of ram, and 2TB of sdd space.

1 We will start by importing in the mongodb, which has works collection, and the authors' collection.


2 Second, we will build unigram parquet files and bigram parquet files, scoring every unigram/bigram in title+authors,
as well as in the abstracts. So we make a unigram/bigram for abstracts, and unigram/bigram for titles+authors.


3 Third of all, we will build a parquet file that contains every work pair with an author in common.
This will go through the mongodb collection.

As we do this, we will add to dataframes a bunch of data that includes work_id, strings, unigrams, bigrams,

-- We are essentially going to copy our old script, but adjust it so that it doesn't create big chunks of data.
We will also have to do big directory changes as well.
-- Also, we will have to fix it up so that it so there is persistent garbage collection, as well as
using gpu parallelism, and also we will train a larger model and a smaller model, and probably we will fix them both up
to be fine-tuned for authors, and for titles.
-- Then, once its all done, we will create a big vector db with them.

Once that is done, we will get to work on the other vectordb that we have in mind.
