I now wish to do the following:

I wish to build an enormous amount of abstracts + paragraphs,
and we shall construct a classifier based off this

All abstract_strings, fields, subfields, topics
shall be split into datasets, and then we will train encoders of various sizes on these datasets.
We shall also include paragraphs.

TODO: This will require our full attention to make.

We want 1 model to do subfield classification
We want 1 model to do field classification
We want 1 model to do topic classification

We want 26 models for subfield classification.
